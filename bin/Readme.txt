This is the Readme file for the Tetris game GUI version written by Emma Nguyen'20 (March 2018) 
This version of the game includes the following features (apart from those required by the course):
- Each type of tetris piece has a different color 
- The game gives a preview of the next piece
- It indicates when the game is over (when a block is above top of the board) 
- It has different levels, where the speed of pieces falling increases as the level increases. The level increases by one with every 5 lines cleared
